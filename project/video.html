          <h2>Rivalry Week</h2>
            <h3>The <strong>Task</strong></h3>
              <p>Many of the top college football programs in the country had begun producing hype videos prior to facing their top rival for use on social media. Senior officials at Miami along with the football coaching staff had taken notice to this and asked the digital strategy deparmtent if we could produce something similar in the week leading up to our largest rivlary game against Florida State. The Associate AD of Marketing and Digital Strategy assigned me this task.</p>
            <h3>The <strong>Idea</strong></h3>
              <p>My idea was simple: create a highlight package timed to action movie trailer music. We had not released a highlight package through the first three months of the season, so my thought was to recap the awesome moments of the season thus far and get fans excited for the game against Florida State.</p>

          <h2>BUC Goin' Up</h2>
            <h3>The <strong>Task</strong></h3>
              <p>Create a video that will get people excited about an important matchup against No. 12 Louisville and encourage them to come to the game.</p>
            <h3>The <strong>Idea</strong></h3>
              <p>My idea was to create something that was witty and inline with pop culture that would get shared amongst fans. Earlier that season, we had a Tuesday home game and I created a highlight video with the popular rap song Tuesday by ILOVEMAKONNEN featuring Drake as the soundtrack. The idea for this video was to replicate that theme, but put a new spin on it. With help from the Marketing department, I was able to get our star point guard, Angel Rodriguez, to sing "Got the BUC going up on a Tuesday." I added in highlights from previous home games that season where there had been a large crowd. I wanted to incorporate another element to really make the video stand out, so I went through our head coach's press conference videos looking for specific words. I editied them together into the video below. Additionally, the most popular part of the video was posted on Vine.</p>

          <h2>Recapping a Special Season</h2>
            <h3>The <strong>Task</strong></h3>
              <p>The Director of Baseball Operations needed a highlight video recapping the 2014 season to show at the team's banquet, which is held just prior to the start of the following season.</p>
            <h3>The <strong>Idea</strong></h3>
              <p>The 2014 season was an incredibly special one for the team that included an ACC Regular Season Championship, a perfect game, three number one SportsCenter plays, and our head coach's 900th win. I wanted to showcase all of those moments in addition to highlights of all the key players in 2014.</p>

              <p>Director of Baseball Operations Robert McDaniel loved the video. Head Coach Jim Morris also personally told me that he enjoyed the video. The video was so popular at the banquet that it ended up being posted on social media by our department. Viewers comments are below.</p>

          <h2>Turnt Up</h2>
            <h3>The <strong>Task</strong></h3>
              <p>The Associate Director of Marketing needed a video that could be played at a timeout at a critical point during home games to get students excited. Additionally, the video would be promoted on social media.</p>
            <h3>The <strong>Idea</strong></h3>
              <p>I wanted to create something that was high energy and played off the electronic dance music culture of Miami. I found this clip in one of Coach Larranaga's press conferences and thought it fit perfectly with the theme of the project. Additionally, I anticipated the Coach L clip would increase the virality of the video.</p>
