          <h2>@TheUBaseball</h2>
            <h3>The <strong>Task</strong></h3>
              <p>The external team was looking to launch an account and develop a presence on Instagram for the baseball team. The Assistant Director of Communications tasked me with creating and managing the account.</p>
            <h3>The <strong>Strategy</strong></h3>
              <p>With many ACC Baseball teams lacking a strong presence on Instagram, I wanted to develop @TheUBaseball into one of the premier baseball accounts in the conference. Content wise, my goal was to provide a behind the scenes tour of the Hurricanes while also providing score updates on game days. I tried to create a voice behind the account that is excited both excited about Canes Baseball and a little bit witty.</p>
              <p>In order to grow a follower base, I leveraged the main Miami Hurricanes Instagram account, which had over 70,000 followers when the baseball account started. Also, I worked with the rest of the baseball external staff to get the account mentioned on Facebook, Twitter, press releases and on the ballpark's public address system.</p>
            <h3>The <strong>Work</strong></h3>
